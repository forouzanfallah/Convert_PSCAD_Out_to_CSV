# Convert_PSCAD_Out_to_CSV

The provided code is a Python script designed to run in Google Colab to convert .out files from PSCAD to CSV files. 

Mounting Google Drive to read data.zip

Two paths are defined - zip_file_path (the location of a ZIP file in your Google Drive) and data_directory (the location where you want to extract and store the data).

Data from .out files is read, converted into pandas DataFrames, and then concatenated.

Extracting headers from .inf files: Headers are extracted from .inf files and assigned to the DataFrame.

Handling mismatch in columns and headers: If there are more columns than headers, 'unknown' is appended to the headers list.

Saving to CSV: The final DataFrame is saved as a CSV file in the data_directory.

Downloading CSV files: Each .csv file found is downloaded to your local machine using files.download(file_path) 

This script is useful for extracting, processing, and downloading data from specific file formats (particularly .out and .inf files), particularly when dealing with large datasets
